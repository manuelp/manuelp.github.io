[![Release It!](https://imagery.pragprog.com/products/93/mnee_xlargecover.jpg?1298589747)](https://pragprog.com/book/mnee/release-it)

* [The Pragmatic Programmer](https://pragprog.com/the-pragmatic-programmer)
* [Practices Of An Agile Developer](https://pragprog.com/book/pad/practices-of-an-agile-developer)
