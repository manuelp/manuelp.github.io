This is a short summary of my takeaways of the article [*-Driven* do not change anything](https://www.infoq.com/articles/star-driven-approaches) by [Micha≈Ç Bartyzel](https://www.infoq.com/author/Micha%C5%82-Bartyzel).

* Mental frameworks (like \*-Driven\*) need to be *intepreted* in the light of the appropriate *context*, and require *experience* to be applied to unknown ones.
* These frameworks are usually formed over many years of experience by *induction*, and adapted to other contexts by *deduction*.
* Instead of focusing on context/experience-dependent mental frameworks, invest in **developing the foundamentals**:
  * Responsibility
  * Encapsulation
  * Composition
