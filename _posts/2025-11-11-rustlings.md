After learning Rust by working through a [course]({% post_url 2025-10-24-learning-pl %}), I've completed the [rustlings](https://rustlings.cool/) exercises. It's a community-maintained set of exercises (with a companion CLI utility) where you must fix compilation errors and write some code to advance to the next exercise.

It's a fun way to practice Rust and to review some concepts, but by itself is not sufficient to learn the language. Furthermore, Rust is not the easiest PL to learn and to cover it in its entirety would require quite a bit more of exercises. I still think that working through a course and/or book and practicing with some small to medium size project is a better way to learn it.

If you need a way to get a feel of the language before committing to learn it, or a concise reference to the syntax, main features and idioms, there are other resources:
